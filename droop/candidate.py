Top-level structure:

  A driver program (for example Droop.py, the CLI)
    1. creates an ElectionProfile from a ballot file,
    2. imports a Rule,
    3. creates an Election(Rule, ElectionProfile, options),
    4. counts the election with Election.count(), and
    5. generates a report with Election.report().

  The options are used to override default Rule parameters, such as arithmetic.
