Top-level structure:

  A driver program (for example Droop.py, the CLI)
    1. creates an ElectionProfile from a ballot file,
    2. imports a Rule,
    3. creates an Election(Rule, ElectionProfile, options),
    4. counts the election with Election.count(), and
    5. generates a report with Election.report().

  The options are used to override default Rule parameters, such as arithmetic.

        The use of slots gives a more compact object, which significantly
        reduces memory requirements for large elections.

        of bytes or shorts (depending on candidate count), again
        for memory efficiency.

        a count of identical ballots.
