PRF Reference Rule: WIGM

A. Initialize Election
   A.1. Set the quota (votes required for election) to the total number of
        valid ballots, divided by one more than the number of seats to be
        filled, plus 0.0001.
   A.2. Set each candidate who is not withdrawn to hopeful.
   A.3. Test count complete (D.3).
   A.4. Set each ballot's weight to one, and assign it to its top-ranked
        hopeful candidate.
   A.5. Set the vote for each candidate to the total number of ballots
        assigned to that candidate.

B. Round
   B.1. Elect winners. Set each hopeful candidate whose vote is greater than
        or equal to the quota to pending (elected with surplus-transfer
        pending). Set the surplus of each pending candidate to that candidate's
        vote minus the quota. Test count complete (D.3).
   B.2. Defeat sure losers (optional). Find the largest set of hopeful
        candidates that meets all of the following conditions.
        B.2.a. The number of hopeful candidates not in the set is greater
               than or equal to the number seats to be filled minus pending and
               elected candidates).
        B.2.b. For each candidate in the set, each hopeful candidate with the
               same vote or lower is also in the set.
        B.2.c. The sum of the votes of the candidates in the set plus the sum
               of all the current surpluses (B.1) is less than the lowest vote
               of the hopeful candidates not in the set.
        If the resulting set is not empty, defeat each candidate in the set
        and test count complete (D.3), transfer each ballot assigned to a
        defeated candidate (D.2), and continue at step B.1.
   B.3. Transfer high surplus. Select the pending candidate, if any, with
        the largest surplus (possibly zero), breaking ties per procedure D.1.
        For each ballot assigned to that candidate, set its new weight to the
        ballot's current weight multiplied by the candidate's surplus (B.1),
        then divided by the candidate's total vote. Transfer the ballot (D.2).
        If a surplus (possibly zero) is transferred, continue at step B.1.
   B.4. Defeat low candidate. Defeat the hopeful candidate with the lowest
        vote, breaking ties per procedure D.1. Test count complete (D.3).
        Transfer each ballot assigned to the defeated candidate (D.2). Continue
        at step B.1.

C. Finish Count
   Set all pending candidates to elected. If all seats are filled, defeat all
   hopeful candidates; otherwise elect all hopeful candidates. Count is complete.

D. General Procedures
   D.1. Break ties. Ties arise in B.3 (choose candidate for surplus
        transfer) and in B.4 (choose candidate for defeat). In each case,
        choose the tied candidate who is earliest in a predetermined random
        tiebreaking order.
   D.2. Transfer ballots. Reassign each ballot to be transferred to its
        highest-ranking hopeful candidate and add the current weight of the
        ballot to the vote of that candidate. If the ballot ranks no such
        candidate, or has a weight of zero, it is exhausted and no longer
        participates in the count.
   D.3. Test count complete. If the number of elected plus pending
        candidates is equal to the number of seats to be filled, or the number
        of elected plus pending plus hopeful candidates is equal to or less
        than the number of seats to be filled, the count is complete; finish at
        step C.
   D.4. Arithmetic. Truncate, with no rounding, the result of each
        multiplication or division to four decimal places.
