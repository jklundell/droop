    Quota Preferential by Quotient (QPQ)

    Procedure (from Woodall paper http://www.votingmatters.org.uk/ISSUE17/I17P1.PDF)

    2.1.  Set each candidate to hopeful
    2.2.  Each ballot has elected 0 candidates
    Round:
    2.3.  Calculate quotient qc (count) of each hopeful candidate c
          qc = vc/(1+tc)
          where vc is number of ballots ranking C first
          tc is sum of all fractional numbers of candidates those ballots
          have so far elected
    2.4.  Quota Q = va/(1+s-tx)
          where va is number of active ballots (ballots with hopeful candidate(s))
          s is total number of seats to be filled
          tx is sum of fractional number of candidates elected by all inactive ballots
    2.5a. Elect candidate with highest quotient if quotient > quota
          update contribution of ballots contributing to c to 1/qc
    2.5b. If no candidate elected in 5a, exclude hopeful with smallest quotient
    2.6.  Count ends when no hopeful candidates remain
