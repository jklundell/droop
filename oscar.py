    This is an approximation of the STV rule used by the Academy for
    best-picture nominations. Some references:
    http://www.thewrap.com/deal-central/column-post/revealed-how-oscar-nominee-ballots-are-counted-12279
    http://oscarvotes123.blogspot.com/
    http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/01/27/oscar-voter-ballot-reader-poll-results/

    According to these references, the quota is recalculated on each round,
    and, at least after the first surplus distribution, candidates with less
    than 1% of the vote are defeated.
